# Feedback Strobe

Feedback strobe is a technology demonstration aid for EE422G Signals and Systems Laboratory at the University of Kentucky. Commisioned by [Dr. Kevin Donohue](https://www.engr.uky.edu/research/researchers/kevin-donohue/), the device will allow students to use LabView to monitor and control motor rotation speed, with the goal of tuning it such that strobing LEDs will 'stand still'
